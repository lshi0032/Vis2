        <h2>What countries experienced the highest number of HIV infections?</h2>

        <p>HIV has been a prominant virus around the would since the 1980s and continues to impact many countries
            today<br>
            The following graph will allow you to explore how the number of infections a country suffered changed over
            time.<br>
            Use the slider to go from 1990 to 2000 and click on each country to see the full all years at once on the
            line chart
        </p>
        <div id="map_line"></div>
        <p>
            <span class="africa">African</span> <span class="bolded">countries suffered considerably more from HIV</span> when compared to the rest
            of the world, countries like <br>
            <span class="eswtini">Eswtini</span>, <span class="lesotho">Lesotho</span>, <span class="zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</span>,<span class="botswana">Botswana</span>,and <span class="southafrica">South Africa</span> all had an annual infection rate above 2% at somepoint
            between 1900 and 2000

        <h2>What can be done to prevent the spread of HIV?</h2>
        <p>
            <br>
            <span class="bolded">HIV</span> is most commonly <span class="bolded">transmitted</span> through <span
                class="bolded">unprotected sex</span> and drug injection equipment.<br>
            It is therefore very important for countries that have high cases of HIV to encourage the use<br>
            of condoms during sex to prevent the transmission of HIV. <br>Condoms are <span class="bolded">90% to 95%
                effective</span> at preventing infection.

    <h2>Infections vs Condom use</h2>
        <div id="scatterplot"></div>
        <div>
            <p>It would make sense for HIV infections to decrease as condom 
                use becomes more frequent but this data does not suggest this.<br>
                This may be due to the fact that countries with high condom use
                have high rates of sex and as a result, those that do not practise<br>
                safe sex are spreading it more quickly.<br>

        <div>
            <p>
                It appears <span class="bolded">people aged 15-49 suffered the most deaths</span> from HIV from 1990-2019. <br>
                Within this group, males aged 20-24 were the most frequenct users of condoms.
